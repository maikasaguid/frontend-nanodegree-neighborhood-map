##Introduction
I don't know about you folks, but p4 got me hungry for some pizza! For Project 5 I will be presenting some top pizza spots on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. You can view these pizza spots on a map or in a list view, and if you click on them, you'll get more information such as their contact details and ratings.

##Instructions
1.  View the live app here: https://rawgit.com/maikasaguid/neighborhood-map/master/dist/index.html
2.  Click the yellow pizza markers to find out more information about a pizza place on the current list.
3.  Switch between lists on the left sidebar or using the menu button at the top left.
4.  Switch between the map and list views on the left sidebar or using the menu button at the top left.
5.  Filter pizza locations by using the text input on the left of the top nav bar or using the menu button at the top left.
6.  In the list view, click on the pizza place name to find out more information.
